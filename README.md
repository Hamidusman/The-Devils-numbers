# The-Devils-numbers

This is a simple game i came up with, its somewhat like a guessing game but with a couple rules to it. In a way, its a combination of guessing game and Rock, Paper, Scissors

the rules:

-- if your num = bots num, you lose the round

-- if your number is divisible by the bots, you lose (and vise verse)

-- if your number is 5 and bot's number is 3, you lose (and vise verse)

-- if your number is 1 and the bot's number is divisible by 2, you lose (and vise verse)

-- if your number is 3 and bot's number is 1, you lose (and vise verse)
